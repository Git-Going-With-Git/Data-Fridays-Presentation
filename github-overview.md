# What is GitHub?

GitHub is a hostd version of git that can be used to collaborate with others. It is usually used as the *centralized* git repository.

Besides git, GitHub also has other features commonly used when collaborating in projects:

- issue management
- discussions
- project management
- wiki

---

# Why is GitHub useful?

GitHub is the leading platform for *open source projects*, as it facilitates working in projects with a team.

- code (or any files, really) lives in the cloud, so you can access your files from anywhere
- central place to manage project
- easy to share work with others
- integrations to other commonly used platforms
- **FREE** (...mostly free)


---

# Terminology

- public repository / private repository
- issue / pull request
- `README.md` / markdown
- organizations
- GitHub pages
- actions / continuous deployment
- author / contributor / owner
- clone / fork

---

# Git Remotes

Git remotes are basically "hosted git" external to one's own computer. They facilitate collaborating with others.

Some popular ones include:

- GitHub
- GitLab
- BitBucket

**Note:** Using *markdown* together with git is common and encouraged.

# A Short Demo üñ±Ô∏è

Overview of the GitHub user interface

# GitHub Is Not Magic. Collaboration Is Still (kinda) Hard

- Using GitHub well requires good project management practices and constant management
- Non-git features are rudimentary
- User interface is busy and may be intimidating
- Learning curve (as with git) may be large

---

# GitHub Configuration

Your local git installation should be configured to authenticate
to a remote such as GitHub to be able to `clone` or `pull` from a GitHub repository. In GitHub, go to *settings* and

1. choose *Developer settings*
1. choose *Personal access tokens*
1. *Generate new token* and choose name (ie *Laptop*)
1. choose an *expiration*
1. copy the generated token. It will **not** be available again.

---

## Connect git to GitHub

The first time `clone`ing a project from GitHub, you will be prompted for a *username* and a *password*. This is misleading as GitHub now requires the personal access token to be used as the password.

Clone this presentation's repository with

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Git-Going-With-Git/Data-Fridays-Presentation
```

and enter your *personal access token* when prompted for password.

# GitHub Features

- organizations, permissions
- GitHub pages
- issues, pull requests
- wiki
- project management
- actions
- packages

## Issues and Pull Requests

When working collaboratively, it becomes very important to have a place to discuss issues (bugs, questions, other problems) that is *close to* where the actual problems live.

GitHub has the concepts of issues, pull requests, discussions, and projects to help with this. 

**DEMO** üñ±Ô∏è

## GitHub Pages

Simple static websites can be hosted on GitHub itself. To host a website on GitHub, the special `gh-page` branch is used. Examples of websites that may be hosted on GitHub pages include:

- documentation
- simple personal website/blog
- R Markdown
- Jupyter Notebooks

# Integration With 3rd Party Apps

There are many third party applications integrate very well with GitHub. Here's a short list of such applications:

- Overleaf üñ±Ô∏è - [Overleaf Example](https://www.overleaf.com/project/615282411e6ff12dfd3ca7be), [Repository Example](https://github.com/rmercadojr/MATH-8371---Homework-02)

- Diagrams dot Net üñ±Ô∏è - [ExampleDiagram.drawio Example](https://github.com/Git-Going-With-Git/Data-Fridays-Presentation/tree/main/examples)
- CoCalc - has GitHub integration but requires paid subscription
- Jira, Monday, ClickUp
- Slack, Teams - useful for notifications
